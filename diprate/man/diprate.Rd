\title{diprate: Analysis of dose-effect data based on drug-induced cell proliferation (DIP) rates}
\description{
Studies of the effects of drugs or other perturbations on cell proliferation 
	(especially cancer cells grown in culture) have generally been performed using percent 
	of viable cells after 72 hours of treatment. We have described the steady-state rate 
	of proliferation achieved after any drug equilibration as the drug-induced 
	proliferation (DIP) rate. In this package we provide functions to process raw data, 
	estimate the DIP rate, and analyze the concentration-dependent effects using the 
	dependent drc package. Some image file parsing functions are also included (e.g. 
	Molecular Dynamics ImageXpress)
}
\details{
A drug-induce proliferation (DIP) rate is defined as the steady-state rate of proliferation
 (in log2 scale) of a population of cells at a particular concentration of drug (which
 can be 0). The \code{diprate} R package is a collection of functions used to process 
 and interpret data consisting of cell counts versus time and relevant treatment
 conditions, such as drugs and drug concentrations.

The main function in \pkg{diprate} is the \code{\link{findDIP}} function that calculates the
 DIP rate of cell counts over time.
